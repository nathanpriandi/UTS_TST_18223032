The problem is that the <pre> tag (which displays the JSON) doesn't wrap long lines of text by default, so the text just overflows its box.

Here’s the simple one-line fix.

🎯 How to Fix It
You just need to add a couple of Tailwind classes to the <pre> tag to tell it to wrap the text.

File to edit: src/pages/api-visualizer.tsx

Find the <pre> tag near the end of the file.

Add the whitespace-pre-wrap and overflow-x-auto classes to its className.

Change this line:

TypeScript

<pre className="bg-ui-bg-subtle p-4">
To this:

TypeScript

<pre className="bg-ui-bg-subtle p-4 whitespace-pre-wrap overflow-x-auto">
This will make the long lines of JSON wrap nicely within the box, and if any line is still too long, the box will scroll horizontally instead of breaking your page layout.

After you redeploy this change, the UI should look perfect.
