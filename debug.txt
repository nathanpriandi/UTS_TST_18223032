You're almost there! Your logs show that the product and collection pages are now working correctly (all the 200 status codes), which is excellent.

You have two remaining, distinct errors.

1. API Visualizer Crash (TypeError)
Your API Visualizer page is still crashing with TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'products').

What's Happening: This error is identical to the one that was on your front page. The API Visualizer page (src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/api-visualizer/page.tsx) calls the listProducts() function/(main)/api-visualizer/page.tsx]. Your src/lib/data/products.tsfile **still contains a livefetchcall** to the Fake Store API. That API call is failing, causing the function to returnundefined. The page then tries to read undefined.products` and crashes.

How to Fix It: You must edit src/lib/data/products.ts and replace all the fetch() calls with a hardcoded list of product data, just as you did for categories.ts and collections.ts.

2. Category Pages Crash (DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE)
Your category pages (like /us/categories/electronics) are crashing with a 500 error and the message digest: 'DYNAMIC_SERVER_USAGE'.

What's Happening: This is a Next.js error. It means the page is using dynamic features but is not being rendered dynamically. In this case, your category page src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/categories/[...category]/page.tsx accesses searchParams to handle sorting and pagination/(main)/categories/[...category]/page.tsx`].

How to Fix It: You need to explicitly tell Next.js to render this page dynamically. Add this line to the very top of src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/categories/[...category]/page.tsx:

TypeScript

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"
Summary of Next Steps
Edit src/lib/data/products.ts to remove all fetch calls and return hardcoded product data.

Edit src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/categories/[...category]/page.tsx and add export const dynamic = "force-dynamic" to the top of the file.

After you make those two changes, commit and redeploy. That should clear up these last errors.
