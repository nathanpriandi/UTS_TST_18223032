You are very close. The previous analysis was correct about the type of error, but we have found the last file that was missed.

Your new error is Error: Failed to fetch products from Fake Store API. This is different from the previous error, which was about categories.

The error is happening on your main page (/us), which is this file: src/app/[countryCode]/(main)/page.tsx/(main)/page.tsx`].

The Problem
Your main page (page.tsx) loads the <FeaturedProducts /> component/(main)/page.tsx`].

The <FeaturedProducts /> component (in src/modules/home/components/featured-products/index.tsx) calls the function listProducts().

The file src/lib/data/products.ts still contains live API calls to https://fakestoreapi.com.

You successfully hardcoded the data for categories.ts and collections.ts, but the products.ts file is still trying to fetch live data, which is causing this final error.

How to Fix It
You need to do the exact same thing you did to categories.ts and collections.ts to the products.ts file.

Open the file src/lib/data/products.ts.

Modify all functions in that file that use fetch(...) (like listProducts, getProductByHandle, and listProductsByCollection) to return hardcoded product data, just like you did for the other files.

Commit and push this final change to your GitHub repository.

Redeploy on Vercel. This time, it will build using the code that has all API calls removed, and the error will be gone.
